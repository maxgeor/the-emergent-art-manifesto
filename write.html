                    The biggest challenge for web designers is the unthinkably huge number of possible ways to solve any given problem. We usually don't think of this because we have our habits and traditions to fall back on, but there are literally billions of possible pixel combinations for each page we make.
        
                    There is a better way to manage this vast complexity than by making big decisions up front and hoping for the best. To make better sites — sites that are functional, beautiful, and "usable" — we have to break our design problems up into small independent chunks based on the real issues within our requirements. Christopher Alexander, who came up with this stuff, calls these chunks patterns.
                    
                    I'm going to show you how to sidestep your habits and assumptions and use patterns to make better design decisions. A lot of fancy stuff has been written about patterns. To be simple and clear in this introduction, I'll just call them chunks.
                    
                    Step one: List your bits
                    Start by making a list of all the specific bits that must fit together for the web page to succeed as a whole. By "bits" I mean any kind of design consideration. So this includes what info the page should get across, what actions it should support, important attitudes of the users, and so on. Do not prioritize, group, or categorize. If you start by grouping and organizing you'll just end up with your original habits and preferences in the end.
                    
                    Here are the bits for a "My Account" page that I recently designed:
                    
                    Company info
                    Insurance info for company
                    My (current user) info
                    Other users on this account
                    My sales rep contact info
                    Current account plan
                    Link to change search preferences
                    Date account was created
                    People rarely view or change insurance info
                    Any user can edit anything except other users' info
                    Changing password is the most likely action
                    People might come here to change search preferences (which are on a separate page)
                    Do this on paper if you're working on your own. It's faster.
                    
                    Step two: Figure out which bits relate to each other
                    Some bits affect each other (like 7 and 12) while others are pretty independent (1 and 9). Some bits will work out better if you think of them together and some bits will be the same regardless of the others. Put the bits into chunks based on whether they impact each other — not based on any conceptual or graphic ideas.
