# The Emergent Art Manifesto

This is a work in progress, and forever will be.

---

The Emergent Art Manifesto (EAM) is an NFT project introducing **Emergent Art** — a new artform enabled by blockchains. 

The EAM works by minting text-only NFTs called **manifestos**. You can only mint a manifesto by **branching** another one. This creates a **tree of linked manifestos**, visualized on the site’s home page. 

## How it works

It’ll all start with **manifesto 0**, a document that introduces the idea of Emergent Art.

By clicking on 0, you’ll go to a page where you can read the manifesto.

You can branch this manifesto by clicking “Branch this manifesto”. This will pop open a page where you can edit its text.

You can add a word, rewrite a sentence, or delete it all and start from scratch. Once you’re done writing, you’ll go to a checkout page, connect your wallet, and pay the minting fee. After the fee is paid…

1. An **NFT of your manifesto** will be dropped into your wallet,
2. Your manifesto will be **saved as a permanent branch** of manifesto 0 (or whichever manifesto you branched), and
3. It’ll be **listed at the top of the home page**. Your manifesto will show up as its number in the index. For example, the 1st branched manifesto will come up as “manifesto 1”.

Now, **anyone will be able to branch your manifesto**. As more manifestos are minted, the list will grow.

## Where's it going?

There are so many possible use-cases for the EAM NFTs. Like all Emergent Artworks, the EAM’s direction and destinations will be created by its community. 

## How can you help?

We're looking for a developer to write smart contracts. If you're interested, [DM Max Georgopoulos on Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxoulos).
